    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p>
      I picked easy recipes for this assignment because I'm more focused on the
      <br />
      actual web development that the recipe. But what is this? I can't tell if
      <br />
      I like it or not. Toasted peanut butter and jelly. I feel like I need to
      <br />
      make this now to try it.

        Top with other slice, so that peanut butter and jelly are in the middle.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook for 4 minutes on each side, or until golden brown, and heated
        through.
