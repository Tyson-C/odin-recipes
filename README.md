TOP - Foundations Project One

My objectives in this project are:
    -improve command line use
    -understand git
    -build up keyboard shortcuts
    -find joy in completing a basic html assignment

I want to work this project as if it were a real life assignment. I hope to set up the html and repo in a way that adapts well with later changes as I learn about CSS and JS.
